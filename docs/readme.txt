=== Notes === 
This release works on 32-bit & 64-bit linux systems.
keyboarding master depends on jinput with modifications.  My modifications
to jinput only support linux at this time.

=== Instructions For Use ===
BitRocks InstallBuilder automatically installs all necessary components
for keyboarding master to function with your devices including the java
runtime environment (JRE).  

To run, double click on the desktop icon or
cd <kbmaster install dir>
./run.bash

To uninstall
cd <kbmaster install dir>
sudo ./uninstall
