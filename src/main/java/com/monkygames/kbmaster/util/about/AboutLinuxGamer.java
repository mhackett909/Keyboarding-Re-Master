		"Linux gaming refers to all game titles that can run on Linux based operating systems. This can refer to free / open source games, which may also be commercial,[1] that run natively on Linux, or proprietary games that have Linux ports. Linux gaming can also refer to Linux based gaming devices such as the Pandora gaming console, or gaming oriented distributions such as SuperGamer. Linux gaming can also be considered to be related to gaming on the Android platform, although there are distinct differences between the two systems and industries. In recent years Linux gaming has also become more closely related to gaming on other alternative platforms, such as Mac gaming."
